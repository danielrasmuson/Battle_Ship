STRATEGIES FOR ME
have my ships faceing different directions they will probably have the same routine pattern for checking 
exclude certain areas if they can not be ships there (the area is too small crosses it off from the board)


could look at this article
http://www.wikihow.com/Win-at-Battleship

What is my problem?
    I need a way to fire on the ship once I have two hits in a row
    Assumption I'm making that both hits are on the same ship
        lets just say they are

then I would have two temporary endpoints
I would set sinking ship process on

always shoots above top end point then 
shoots below bottom end point
if the ship is not sunk it recalls itself with the new endpoitns
